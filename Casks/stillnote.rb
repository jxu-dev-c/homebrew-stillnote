  caveats <<~EOS
    Download the speech model once in Stillnote Settings.
    This app is ad-hoc signed. macOS may require approval in Privacy & Security.
    The stillnote command reads and corrects meetings and controls recording while the
    app is open; it can be switched off in Settings > Advanced.
